# Square One Extensions

Square One is a light distribution of Joomla! It is being designed to meet the needs of developers who want a cleaner installation than Joomla. It removes many of the core extensions that are not required, so that you can install only the extensions that you need for your website.

Square One CMS has removed many of the core extensions, and will be making them available as a separate download. These are the currently supported extensions.

 * Banners Component
 * Contacts Component
 * Newsfeeds Component

## Who is running this?

Jeremy Wilken of Gnome on the run (www.gnomeontherun.com) is heading this initiative to give the Joomla! community an option for a lighter weight distribution.
